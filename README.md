## What is Calcigral
**WIP**

<!-- Wikirace is a single-/multiplayer game about traversing links from one wikipedia page to another.

Players are given two wikipedia page titles. Their goal is to make their way from the one to the other by only clicking
links on the wikipedia page they are on. The faster you get to the goal page, the more points you get! 
You can read more about rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game). -->

## Features
<!-- * Both singleplayer and multiplayer supported
* Automatic round generation
* Persistence of state after page refresh 
* Asynchronous websockets
* Postgresql and Redis databases
* Automatic deploy and CI/CD -->
**WIP**
* Haskell
* Three calculation strategies: `Rectangle`, `Trapezoid`, `Paraboloid`
* Command-line interface

## Goals of this project
**WIP**

This utility is a educational project for JetBrains Functional Programming at Constructor University</a>.
Therefore it's main purpose is familiarizing myself with various technologies.
